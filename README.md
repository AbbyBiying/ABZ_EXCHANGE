I do both Classical and Mockist testing styles in my unit tests.

I also do integration/feature tests, from the perspective of a user, using RSpec with Capybara as well as Cucumber with Capybara. I enjoy writing user stories out of Cucumber steps in plain English.

With RSpec, I use FactoryGirl to set up database records for testing in order to keep my test code clean and isolate the causes and effects in each specific test.
